Project for Course I took at SNHU

What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

In this course we did a project for a company making a menu that students can use to look at the classes and prerequisites that they need to take for the course. They can also see what classes they have taken and what they need to take next. It also displays the course list in alphabetical order. 

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

I used vectors and the tree method to sort the list as this was what I found to be the most efficient way to get the job done as the runtimes would be the fastest. 

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

If I had trouble with any of the assingments I stepped away from it for a little bit and came back to it with a fresh mind. That usually did the trick. If I still could not figure it out I would do some research on StackOverflow. There is a lot of resources on there that can help you figure out how to solve several problems.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

I have learned that there are many ways to solve most problems and so many different ways to code as long as you are following the basic rules. There are also a lot of things to consider before you ven start writing your code such as strategies or what methods of code you are going to use. It taught me to do my research and figure out what is going to be the most efficient way to build the best program I can for whoever I am building it for.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

It has taught me how to decide what I should use in my code before I start actually writing it. This will help me build stronger programs in the future that will last longer as I can make it run the most efficently and make it adaptable for future updates and changes.
